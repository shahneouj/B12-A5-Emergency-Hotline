## Answer the following questions clearly:

    What is the difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?
  
    Answer : getElementBYId  gets the dom element by id.  getElementsByClassName is gets the dom element by class name. And querySelector are use to get the dom element both by id and class name. But only the first element of the  dom with given class name, querySelectorAll gets all the element of the dom with given class name.

    How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

    Answer: we can create  an element with the createElement method and insert new element with the appendChild.
    
    What is Event Bubbling and how does it work?

    Answer:The event bubbling is  a child has an event add to it now if the parent also has same event then if the child element start the event then the event will go up to his parent element and it will also start the event. It is like a bubble going up to the sky. 

    What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

    Answer:Event delegation is  a javaScript trick to apply an event lister to the parent and the child will get the event automatic. so we can use one event to control the all the child events and actions.
    What is the difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods?

    Answer:preventDefault() is use in input form to prevent the reload of the browser when submitting the form. stopPropagation() is use to  prevent the event bubbling so that the 
    event will not go to the parent element, it will not effect the parent element.
